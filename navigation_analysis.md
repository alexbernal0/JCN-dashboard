URL: https://hbretonniere-surviz--home-page-9r8djm.streamlit.app/

## Sidebar Structure Observed:
The sidebar contains ONLY navigation links to different pages:
- 👋 Home page
- 🔭 General info
- 🎨 Filters
- 📈 characteristics
- 👁️ FOV
- 🌌 Galaxy
- ✨ Galaxy field
- 🪞 Mirror
- 🗺️ Survey footprint

## Key Observations:
1. Sidebar is MINIMAL - only page navigation
2. No controls or inputs in sidebar
3. Clean, icon-based navigation
4. Light grey background
5. All content and controls are on the main page

## Implementation for JCN Dashboard:
1. Keep sidebar minimal with page navigation only
2. Move all controls (time horizon, portfolio table) to main page
3. Use similar clean design with icons
4. Start with single "Home" page, can add more pages later
