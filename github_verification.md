## Conclusion:
The GitHub repository IS up to date with our latest changes. The issue is that Streamlit Cloud at https://jcnfinancial.streamlit.app/ has NOT auto-redeployed.

## Likely Issue:
The Streamlit Cloud deployment may be:
1. Pointing to a different repository
2. Pointing to a different branch
3. Not configured for auto-deploy
4. Needs manual reboot/redeploy

## Solution:
Need to access Streamlit Cloud dashboard to check deployment settings and trigger manual redeploy.
